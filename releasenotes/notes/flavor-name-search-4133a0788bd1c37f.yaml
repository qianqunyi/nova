    The v2.102 microversion has been introduced. This allows users to search
    flavors by name, e.g.::

        GET /flavors?name=gpu

    In addition, the ``rxtx_factor`` and ``OS-FLV-DISABLED:disabled`` fields
    have been removed from all flavors responses, while the ``rxtx_factor``
    field can no longer be provided when creating a server. Finally, all APIs
    now reject unknown query string parameters with a HTTP 400 (Bad Request)
    error, building upon work first started in microversion 2.75.
