    The v2.102 microversion has been introduced. This allows users to search
    flavors by name, e.g.::

        GET /flavors?name=gpu

    In addition, the ``rxtx_factor`` and ``OS-FLV-DISABLED:disabled`` fields
    have been removed from all flavors responses, while the ``rxtx_factor``
    field can no longer be provided when creating a server.
