deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[filter_scheduler] aggregate_image_properties_isolation_namespace``
    and ``[filter_scheduler] aggregate_image_properties_isolation_separator``
    config options have been deprecated for removal. These have been
    effectively unusable since the 12.0.0 (Liberty) release, which removed the
    ability for the ``AggregateImagePropertiesIsolation`` scheduler filter to
    filter on any non-standard image metadata property. Users who require this
    functionality should consider enforcing `aggregate isolation using
    placement traits`__.
