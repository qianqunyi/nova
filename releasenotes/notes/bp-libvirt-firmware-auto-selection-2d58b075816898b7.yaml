features:

    Now the libvirt virt driver uses firmware auto-selection by libvirt, which
    is capable to select the appropriate firmware files according to
    the requested features. This built-in auto-selection extends the existing
    firmware selection capability within nova, and checks a few more feature
    flags such as amd-sev and also supports new firmware types such as rom
    firmware.

upgrades:

    Existing UEFI guests may start using a new firmware file after operations
    like rebuild or resize (including cold-migration) which generates libvirt
    domain XML from scratch, due to the extended logic to select
    the appropriate files.
