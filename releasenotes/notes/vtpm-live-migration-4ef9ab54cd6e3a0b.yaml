    The libvirt driver now supports live migration of servers with virtual
    emulated TPM (vTPM) when the ``hw:tpm_secret_security`` flavor extra spec
    is set to ``host``. Operators must create flavors which set
    ``hw:tpm_secret_security`` in order to enable servers to select a
    particular TPM secret security mode. Pre-existing servers can opt-in to the
    ``host`` TPM secret security mode by resizing to a flavor which has set
    ``hw:tpm_secret_security`` to ``host``. Operators may choose which TPM
    security modes they want to support by setting the
    ``[libvirt]supported_tpm_secret_security`` configuration option on compute
    hosts. See the documentation for details:
